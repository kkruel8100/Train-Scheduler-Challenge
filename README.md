# Train-Scheduler-Challenge

### This app is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure dta.  The app retrieves and manipulates the information with Moment.js.  The website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### App componenets:

#### When adding trains, administrators can submit the following:

	1. Train Name
	2. Destination
	3. First Train Time - in military time
	4. Frequency - in minutes

#### The app calculates the next train arrival relative to the current time.

#### This app differs from the Train-Scheduler with the additional component of updating the "minutes to arrival" and the "next train time" once every minute.
